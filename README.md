# Partition-List

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        before, after = ListNode(0), ListNode(0)
        before_curr, after_curr = before, after
        
        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                before_curr.next, before_curr = head, head
            else:
                after_curr.next, after_curr = head, head
            head = head.next
        
        after_curr.next = None
        before_curr.next = after.next
        
        return before.next
